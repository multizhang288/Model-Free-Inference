This data set contains 120 twelve-week old male rats from which over 18976 different probes (After initial feature screening) from eye tissue were measured The intensity values were normalized using the RMA (robust multi-chip averaging, \cite{bolstad2003comparison}) method to obtain summary expression values for each probe. Our goal is to identify the probes that could significantly impact the gene  TRIM32 (probe ID 1389163_at),, which was previously reported in \cite{chiang2006homozygosity} as a potential cause of Bandet-Biedl syndrome, a genetically heterogeneous disease of multiple organ systems including the retina.
